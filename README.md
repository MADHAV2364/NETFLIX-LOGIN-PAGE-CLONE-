This project is a simple clone of the Netflix login page, built using only HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to recreate the clean, modern design of Netflix's login screen with basic front-end technologies.

Features:
1. Responsive Layout: Adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
2. Sleek Design: Mimics Netflix's signature dark theme, with a polished look and smooth styling.
3. Login Form: Includes email/password fields with basic form styling, placeholders, and a "Sign In" button.
4. Background Image: Uses a full-screen background image for a cinematic effect.
5. Footer Links: Styled footer links such as "Need help?" or "Forgot password?" similar to the real Netflix page.
6. This clone does not include any JavaScript or back-end functionalityâ€”it's focused purely on recreating the design and layout using CSS.
